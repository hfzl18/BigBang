# BigBang

This Java project iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 and replaces specific numbers with words based on given conditions. It generates an `output.json` file containing the resulting array after the iteration reaches 100.

The conditions are as below:
* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "BIG".
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "BANG".
* Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "BIGBANG".

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on system.

## Execution Steps
This code can be run either using terminal or Java IDE.

### Terminal
1. Download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `BigBang.java` file is located.
3. Compile the Java file by executing the command: `javac BigBang.java`
4. Run the compiled Java program by executing the command: `java BigBang`
5. After the program runs successfully, you should see the message "Output generated successfully!" printed in the console.
6. Check the same directory for the `output.json` file containing the desired output.

### JavaIDE
1. Download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Open the `BigBang.java` file and save it in your preferred directory.
4. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac BigBang.java`
5. Run the compiled file using the command: `java BigBang`
6. After successful execution, an `output.json` file will be generated in the same directory, containing the resulting array.

## Output

The generated `output.json` file will contain an array of strings representing the numbers from 1 to 100, with replacements applied according to the given conditions.
